The art of manuscript illumination reached its peak during <span className="annotation" data-note="This period spans roughly from the 11th to the 13th centuries">the High Middle Ages</span>. The intricate process of creating these manuscripts involved multiple craftspeople, from scribes to illustrators[^1].

The most notable developments occurred in scriptoria across Europe[^ref1], where monks dedicated their lives to preserving knowledge. These centers of learning became crucial for the transmission of classical texts[^2].

The materials used in manuscript production were incredibly valuable[^ref2]. <span className="annotation" data-note="Parchment was made primarily from sheep, goat, or calf skin">Parchment, made from carefully prepared animal skins, served as the primary writing surface</span>.
