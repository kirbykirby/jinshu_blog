        { type: "text", content: "Murong Huang, courtesy name Yuanzhen, was the third son of Hui. He had a dragon-like countenance and prominent teeth, standing seven chi and eight cun tall. He was valiant, resourceful, and devoted to classical studies, with expertise in astronomy. When Hui was Duke of Liaodong, he appointed Huang as heir apparent. In early Jianwu era, he was appointed Champion General and Left Wise Prince, enfeoffed as Marquis of Wangping, and led troops in campaigns, accumulating numerous achievements. At the end of Taining era, he was appointed General Who Pacifies the North and promoted to Duke of Joseon. After Hui's death, he succeeded to the position, serving as Inspector of Pingzhou while retaining his role as General Who Pacifies the North, overseeing internal affairs. Soon after, when Yuwen Qidegui was driven out by his subordinate Yidougui and died in exile, Huang led cavalry to punish them. Yidougui, in fear, sued for peace. Huang then built two cities, Yuyin and Anjin, before returning."}

His maternal brothers Ren, Commander of Conquering Barbarians, and Zhao, Commander of Broad Martial Force, were both favored by Hui, which also displeased Huang. When Hui died, they all feared they would not be tolerated. At this time, Han fled to Duan Liao, while Ren persuaded Zhao to raise troops to depose Huang. Huang killed Zhao and sent envoys to investigate Ren's intentions, encountering Ren at Xiandu. Realizing his plot was discovered, Ren killed Huang's envoys and fled east to Pingguo. Huang dispatched his brothers You, Commander of Establishing Martial Force, and Marshal Tong Shou to suppress him. Ren fought with all his forces, greatly defeating You and his men, who were all captured by Ren. The Magistrate of Xiangping Wang Bing and General Sun Ji rebelled against Huang in Liaodong, while Colonel of Eastern Barbarians Feng Chou, Army Protector Yi Yi, Minister of Liaodong Han Jiao, and Administrator of Xuantu Gao Xu abandoned their cities and fled. Ren thus occupied all territory east of Liao, declaring himself General of Cavalry and Chariots, Inspector of Pingzhou, and Duke of Liaodong. Yuwen Gui, Duan Liao, and various Xianbei tribes all provided him support."},

Official Liu Pei attacked Yilian but failed. Duan Liao then raided Tuhe, but Huang's general Zhang Meng intercepted and defeated him. Liao's brother Lan and Han attacked Liucheng, but were defeated by Commander Shi Cong. After ten days, Lan and Han again besieged Liucheng, and Huang dispatched Murong Han of Ningyuan and Feng Yi to rescue it. Huang warned Han: \"The enemy is numerous and fierce, difficult to engage directly. Consider safety above all and do not advance rashly. Wait until the troops are assembled and formations are in order before attacking.\" Han, being naturally impetuous, sent over a thousand cavalry as vanguard. Feng Yi tried to stop him, but Han did not comply. He was defeated by Lan, losing more than half his men. Lan again attacked Liucheng, using scaling ladders and tunnels, maintaining the siege for twenty days. Shi Cong personally led his troops in a sortie, defeating them and taking fifteen hundred heads. Lan then fled and returned.",

She Yiyu led cavalry to pursue and fight at Hun River, but was again defeated. When Huang planned to cross the sea to attack Ren, all his subordinates advised against it, saying the sea route was dangerous and treacherous, and that they should take the land route instead. Huang said: \"In the past, the sea never froze, but since Ren's rebellion, it has frozen three times. Emperor Guangwu of Han once used the ice of the Hutuo River to achieve his great enterprise. Perhaps Heaven wishes me to take advantage of this opportunity! My decision is final - anyone who tries to discourage this plan will be executed!\" He then led his three armies to advance across the ice from Changli. Ren did not expect Huang's arrival, and scouts only reported when the army was seven li from Pingguo. Ren hastily went out to battle, was captured by Huang, who then killed him and returned." },
